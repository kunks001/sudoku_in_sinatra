This repo contains my response to a project set by Enrique Riepenhausen and Alex Peattie during Week five of Makers Academy

Sudoku in Sinatra Details
-------------------------
	Using the sudoku solver engine written in week four (see 'Sudoku' repo), create a sudoku web game:
		* it should be able to generate hard and easy sudoku puzzles
		* it should be able to highlight incorrect answers
		* it should b able to show players the correct solution
		* it should be possible to save the current game
